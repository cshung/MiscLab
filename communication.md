# Effective communication checklist

- If I am asking for something, did I make an effort to make it sounds easy for others?
- Am I saying somethng that is obviously agreed upon everyone already?
- Can I turn a thing that I want to talk about into a question and let my audience spell it out?
- Can I turn the communication so that they will talk a lot about themselves?
- Is there an opportunity I should show appreciation?
- Long message can sound like criticism, try to keep it short.
